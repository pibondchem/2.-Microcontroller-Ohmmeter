# 2.-Microcontroller-Ohmmeter
A simple Ohmmeter for Adafruit or Arduino microcontrollers.

The second in a series of micro-controller based labs suitable for physics students
at the HS or college level.  In addition to introducing students to resistors in
parallel and in series, the ohmmeter is construced.  This incorporates some basic 
cirucit building and simple programmming into the project.
