# 2.-Microcontroller-Ohmmeter
A simple Ohmmeter for Adafruit or Arduino microcontrollers.

The second in a series of micro-controller based labs suitable for physics students
at the HS or college level.  In addition to introducing students to resistors in
parallel and in series, the ohmmeter is construced.  This incorporates some basic 
cirucit building and simple programmming into the project.

Keep in mind that if you download the .tex files, you will need the pics/ folders as
well in order to compile the document.

Please let me know if you use these.  Comments are appreciated.
